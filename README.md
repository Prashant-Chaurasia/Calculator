# Calculator - A Simple Android App

This app is basically build to learn Android Fundamentals. The app is being made by watching the videos of wiseAss channel on youtube. 
In this app Butterknife library is used. Its an open source library and very much similar to android annotations and it is used to bind the views
that is we can eliminate ```findViewById ``` calls and just use ```@BindView``` on fields as well as set the ```OnClickListeners``` at a single go by annotating methods
with ```@OnClick``` .
